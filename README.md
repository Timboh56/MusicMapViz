Music Map is a javascript application that uses jQuery, jVectorMap and last FM's API. It visualizes a top ranking artist or track's popularity across user selected countries on a world map and creates a color code that determines the relative popularity of the selected artist or track for the selected country. It can also display the top performing artists and tracks for any country clicked on.
